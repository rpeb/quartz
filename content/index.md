title: About me

**Hey there! ðŸ‘‹**  
Iâ€™m a **Software Developer by day**, a **relentless tinkerer by night**, and an **overthinking philosopher 24/7**. If thereâ€™s a rabbit hole, Iâ€™ve probably fallen into itâ€”whether itâ€™s debugging code or questioning the meaning of life (often both at once).

Tired of mindlessly consuming content, Iâ€™m on a mission to **[[create]] more, write more, and maybe even make sense of the chaos in my head**. When Iâ€™m not coding or overanalyzing everything, youâ€™ll find me experimenting with side projects, tweaking things just for fun, or trying (and failing) to resist learning yet another new framework.

Letâ€™s connect and build something cool! ðŸš€
